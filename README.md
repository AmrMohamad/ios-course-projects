# iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp

## Overview

This document serves as a record of my progress as I learn iOS development through the ["The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/) course created by Angela Yu. The goal of this project is to become proficient in creating iOS applications using the Swift programming language and the Xcode development environment by following along and completing the projects within the course.

## Completed Projects

- **I Am Rich**: A basic app that displays a diamond on the screen and is used as a demonstration of setting up a new Xcode project and understanding the basics of iOS app development. (Done)
  <details>
    <summary>Objectives</summary>
    - How to create and set up a new iOS project from scratch
    - Designing the app in Xcode using iOS components
    - adding image assets into the app
    - designing and creating a custom app icon
    - running the app on a simulator
  </details>

## In Progress Projects

- **Dicee**: A simple app that allows users to roll two virtual dice by shaking their device or tapping a button. Utilized concepts such as handling user input, generating random numbers, and updating the UI.

    - Designing the user interface.
    - Changing UI Elements programmatically.
    - Detect user interaction and respond to it.
    - Using Swift variables and arrays to store data
    - using randomisation in Swift
  </details>


- **Magic 8 Ball**: A virtual magic 8 ball app that provides a random answer to a yes or no question when shaken or the ask button is pressed. Utilized concepts such as handling device motion, and displaying alerts.

- **Quizzler**: A Quiz app that allows users to test their knowledge on different topics with multiple choice questions. Utilized concepts such as creating and manipulating arrays, controlling the flow of the app with if-else statements and more.
